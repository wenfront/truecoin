            The world economy is undergoing a seismic shift as digital
            cryptocurrencies overcome the limits and inefficiencies of
            government-issued fiat currencies. The new cryptocurrency revolution
            is poised to bring full economic equity to everyone, with complete
            access to financial tools that are currently reserved for investment
            bankers and their wealthy customers.

            The new cryptocurrency world was born in the world of computer
            science, with algorithms and data structures complicated enough to
            bewilder all but the most advanced software engineers. But today,
            crypto is available to everyone.

          What Is Cryptocurrency?
        </h2>
        <p>
          What is crypto? It depends who you ask. Ask a software engineer to
          define cryptocurrency and you’ll hear about algorithms and data
          structures. Pose the same question – “what are cryptocurrencies?” – to
          bankers and government regulators, and they’ll describe a populist
          movement that requires a careful response. And to millions of
          investors, crypto is an opportunity to provide for their futures and
          their families.

          How Does Cryptocurrency Work?

        <p class="mb-3">
          The “crypto” part of the word “cryptocurrency” refers to the
          encryption that is provided on all modern digital currencies.
          Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Dogecoin have value because people
          pay to buy them. Crypto can then be traded for goods, services, or
          government-issued currencies like euros.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
          Most people acquire cryptocurrency by purchasing coins and tokens
          online from exchanges or by selling something and accepting
          cryptocurrency as payment. Some earn coins by using their computers to
          validate transactions on the blockchain. The performance of these
          calculations is rewarded with newly minted coins in a process called
          mining.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin, the source code specified an
          arbitrary limit on the total number of Bitcoins that could be minted –
          about 21 million. At the beginning of 2021, there were only about 2.4
          million Bitcoins yet to be created and put into circulation.

        <p class="mb-3">
          News reports make it seem that crypto investors are subject to scams
          and hack attacks on a regular basis.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
          Some of these losses occurred years ago at crypto exchanges that did
          not apply modern security measures to the money they held for
          customers.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
          Others are due to software bugs in particular applications, especially DeFi apps.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite these attention-getting losses, crypto technology is actually quite secure. Blockchains provide immutable records of transactions, and as long as no one gains access to your account, your crypto funds should be safe.

        <p class="mb-3">
          Cryptocurrency has the potential to be a populist alternative to the
          banking system’s monopoly on financial markets and investing. It could
